/**
 * USER SECTIONS — folders the user makes, not folders the topology makes.
 *
 * The roster already had sections (`roster-sections.tsx`), but only AUTOMATIC
 * ones: one per gateway connection, plus the group-chat bucket. Those answer
 * "where does this bot run", which is not the question you are asking when you
 * want two client bots filed together under "Clients".
 *
 * So this is a SECOND axis, and it composes with the first rather than
 * replacing it. Two deliberate choices:
 *
 *   * The membership lives on the BOT (`sectionId` in its ui_meta), not as a
 *     member list on the section. A bot can only be in one place, deleting a
 *     section cannot orphan anybody, and the assignment rides the same
 *     profile.yaml sync every other bot setting already uses — so sections
 *     follow the profile to another machine.
 *   * "Unassigned" is not a section. It is whatever is left, always drawn
 *     last, and it is where members of a deleted section land. With no
 *     sections at all the roster renders exactly as it did before.
 *
 * Pure model + session atoms. No JSX — the pane composes it.
