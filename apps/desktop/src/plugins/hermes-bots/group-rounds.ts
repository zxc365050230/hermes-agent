// Behavioral model (clean-room): a group conversation is ONE ordered room log
// owned by the plugin. A user send triggers at most GROUP_CHAT_MAX_ROUNDS
// serial round-robin rounds over the member roster — never parallel, no LLM
// router. Who speaks each round is a deterministic @mention parse since the
// last user message (mentioned members only, else everyone); whether a member
// actually speaks is its own turn's choice — replying with exactly "(pass)"
// (or nothing, or failing) is silence. Hard caps end every turn; a round in
// which everyone passed means the conversation settled. Each member runs its
// turn in its OWN persistent per-group Hermes session and is fed only the
// room messages that are NEW since it last saw the room.

 *  sends ever reach this (bot replies are appended by the round loop, never
 *  through sendToGroupChat), so a bot saying "stopped working on it" can
 *  never set a hold. Conservative on purpose: a standalone stop/halt/pause
 *  word NEXT TO a mention (within two words, #103893) holds those members —
 *  "don't stop @x" therefore also holds, which errs toward the bot staying
 *  quiet until re-addressed (a wrongly-held bot is one mention away from
 *  release; a wrongly-running one keeps doing work it was told to stop).
 *  A stop word far from every mention is ambiguous — "@x go, das ist halt
 *  ein Test" and "@x mach mal Pause" are prose that addresses the bot, so
 *  non-English rooms whose everyday vocabulary overlaps the keyword list
 *  are not silently held — but "@x please just stop now" is a genuine stop,
 *  so the message is NEUTRAL: it neither holds nor releases. A missed hold
 *  is one adjacent "stop @x" away from repair; re-dispatching a bot the user
 *  just told to stop is the one flip this classifier must never make.
 *  A non-stop direct mention releases the mentioned members — the user
 *  addressing a bot directly overrides its hold — and

 *  3. Sends session.interrupt to the member currently ON TURN (room.turn,

 *     dies instead of grinding to completion in the background. Best-effort:
