/**
 * PROFILE DOT STATE — the profile rail's per-profile rollup of the shared
 * session dot state ($sessionDotStateById), so a profile that finished (or
 * blocked, or is still working) while another profile was selected shows an
 * indicator on its rail square and in the condensed profile dropdown (#91710).
 *
 * The session-level layers already exist and stay authoritative: the live
 * busy→idle edge, the persisted per-profile unread markers
 * ($unreadFinishedMarkers, which survive restarts), and the backend's derived
 * row.unread watermark — all folded by session-dot-state.ts into ONE state per
 * session. This module only re-buckets those resolved states by the profile
 * that owns each session, keyed by the same composite (connection, profile)
 * scope the gateway registry uses (backendScopeKey), so identically named
 * profiles on different gateways never cross-mark.
 *
 * Three passes, weakest claim first (a later pass overwrites on priority, the
 * same rule session-dot-state applies per session):
 *
 * 1. LOADED ROWS — every listed chat/messaging row claims its own scope from
 *    its (connection_id, profile) tags. Cron rows are deliberately EXCLUDED:
 *    cron runs finish unwatched by design and counting them would turn every
 *    profile's square into a permanently lit cron-run counter (#93552).
 * 2. UNLISTED RUNTIMES — a live (busy / needs-input) session whose row is not
 *    loaded (an inactive profile's background work, a hidden Bot Chat) claims
 *    the scope its socket proved (runtimeSessionOwner: the exact registry
 *    (connection, profile), or the legacy profile-only pool's bare name).
 *    No proven owner → no claim: no dot rather than a wrong one.
 * 3. PERSISTED UNREAD MARKERS — the cross-profile, cross-restart half. A
 *    marker with no loaded row is an unread session in a profile whose rows
 *    are not on screen. Markers are bucketed by BARE profile name (see
 *    session-unread.ts), so they are attributed to a (connection, profile)
 *    scope only when the gateway that owns that profile name is unambiguous —
 *    loaded rows' connections, the active gateway, and the fleet roster must
 *    all agree. Two gateways exposing the same profile name leave that bucket
 *    unpainted rather than guessing (#91710: identically named profiles stay
 *    independently scoped).
