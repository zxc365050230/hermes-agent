// with this module's serialized result. Enumeration uses `get-windows`
// (front-to-back z-order on macOS/Windows/Linux-X11); the picking logic is a
// pure function so the OS-specific part stays a thin provider. Where that
// provider can't run at all, the answer is why — see `enumerationFailureNote`.

// permission; we pass titles through only when that permission is ALREADY
// granted and never trigger the prompt for it.

 * Why enumeration just failed, in terms the user can act on.
 *
 * The generic "could not determine the window underneath" this replaces is a
 * dead end on Linux, where the two ways it fails have opposite fixes and
 * neither is guessable: a Wayland session withholds window identity from
 * applications outright, and an X11 session needs `xprop`/`xwininfo` present
 * because that is what the enumerator shells out to.
 *
 * A session with both `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `DISPLAY` is Wayland running
 * XWayland, where `xprop` can still answer — so it is treated as X11 and gets
 * the tooling advice rather than being told to change session type.
 *
 * macOS and Windows have no environmental fork like that, so their note is
 * whatever the enumerator actually said. That `detail` is the whole point: a
 * bare "could not enumerate windows on this system" is what a real report came
 * back with (macOS 26, packaged app), and neither the tool result nor the
 * desktop log said whether the module failed to load, the helper failed to
 * spawn, or the OS answered with nothing — three failures with three different
 * fixes, all collapsed into one sentence.
