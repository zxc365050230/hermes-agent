/**
 * pool-stop.ts
 *
 * Bounded, deduplicated teardown for pooled profile backends.
 *
 * Idle reaping, LRU eviction, profile deletion, and app quit can all ask to
 * stop the same pooled backend, and historically each caller SIGTERM'd the
 * child and immediately deleted the pool entry. A child that did not exit
 * promptly lost its only handle and survived detached under PID 1 — a live
 * installation accumulated 41 orphaned profile backends this way.
 *
 * createPoolStopper() gives every caller the same contract instead:
 *  - the pool entry is evicted immediately (no router hands out a dying
 *    backend), but the stop promise keeps the process handle until the
 *    bounded SIGTERM -> SIGKILL escalation in waitForExit resolves;
 *  - concurrent stop requests for one key share the single in-flight stop;
 *  - spawn paths can await inFlight(key) so a fresh child never overlaps a
 *    dying one on the same HERMES_HOME.
 *
 * Extracted into a dependency-free module (same pattern as backend-child.ts /
 * pool-eviction.ts) so the dedup and handle-retention semantics are asserted
 * directly instead of grepping main.ts source text.
